## Slovenian full-time Sole Proprietorship (S.P.)

There are 2 basic types of tax regimes available for S.P.:
- Normalized Expenses (Normiran S.P.)
- Actual Expenses (Navaden S.P.)

### The tax rates for **Normiran S.P.** in 2025 working full-time

- **4%** on income up to **€60,000** per year  
  *(80% of income is automatically considered expenses, leaving 20% as taxable profit, which is taxed at 20%)*

- If your revenue **exceeds €60,000** you cannot use the Normalized Expenses and will have to use Regular S.P. that has progressive inclome tax rates for 2024:
  - **16%** from **€8,755€**
  - **26%** from **€8,755€** to **€25,750€**
  - **33%** from **€25.750€** to **€51.500€**
  - **39%** from **€51.500€** to **€74.160€**
  - **50%** from **€74.160€**

### Social Contributions

In addition to income tax, social contributions are mandatory:

- Contributions are divided into categories for **pension**, **healthcare** and **insurances**.
- The amount you pay is based on the actual profit from the previous fiscal year. In the first year, you pay the minimum amount. From the second year onward, contributions are re-calculated based on your revenue and formal profit each year. Total percentage is **38,40%**, breakdown is as follows:
  - Pension (PIZ) **24,35%**
    - there is a **Pension Contribution Discount** given for newly opened S.P.:
      - **50% discount** for the first 12 months of operating as an S.P.
      - **30% discount** for the second 12 months.
      - From the 25th month onward, contributions are paid in full, based on the formal income from the previous fiscal year.
 
  - Healthcare (ZZ) **13,45%** + **€35 fixed surcharge**

  - Insurances **0,40%**

- There is a minimum contribution that needs to be paid even if you are not generating any profit. It is approximately **€544.04 per month** for 2024 and is re-calculated each year based on the average salary in Slovenia for the previous year.
