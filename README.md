2.  **Social Contributions (Prispevki):** Uses the correct "steady-state" formula to calculate the insurance base from gross profit, including the new Long-term Care (*Dolgotrajna oskrba*) contribution.
3.  **Effective Tax Rate:** Tells you exactly what percentage of your revenue goes to the state.
