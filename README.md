# [Visit the Calculator](https://ankhezar.github.io/si.tax.calculator/)

A small FAQ on what is what below

### The tax rates for **Normiran S.P.** in 2025

- **4%** on income up to **€60,000** per year  
  *(80% of income is automatically considered expenses, leaving 20% as taxable profit, which is taxed at 20%)*

- If your revenue **exceeds €60,000** you cannot use the normalized expenses and will have to use regular S.P.

### Social Contributions

In addition to taxes, social contributions are required:

- **No single minimum social contribution** is mandated.
- Contributions are divided into categories for **pension**, **disability**, and **healthcare**.
- The amount you pay is based on the actual profit from the previous fiscal year. In the first year, you pay the minimum amount. From the second year onward, contributions are recalculated based on your revenue and formal profit.
- The minimum contribution is approximately **€544.04 per month** for 2024. It is re-calculated each year based on the average salary in Slovenia.
